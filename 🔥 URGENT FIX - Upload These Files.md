## 🎯 **What's Fixed:**

- ❌ Game cut off at bottom (iframe too small)
- ❌ Scrollbars showing (not optimized)

### **After:**
- ✅ All topics load perfectly (A1, A2, Random modes)
- ✅ Full game visible (800px height)
- ✅ No scrollbars (clean iframe)
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ AdSense optimized layout

---

## 📱 **Mobile Improvements:**
- Sidebar hides on mobile (more space for game)
- Responsive iframe sizing
- Touch-friendly interface

---

## 💰 **AdSense Ready:**
- Homepage: 5 ad spaces for maximum revenue
- Game page: 2 ad spaces (won't interfere with gameplay)
- Mobile optimized for better ad performance

---

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

### **File Structure:**
```
Your Netlify Site:
├── index.html (Homepage - AdSense optimized)
├── game.html (Game page - iframe container)
├── play.html (Actual game - loads in iframe)
├── script.js (Game logic)
├── styles.css (Game styling)
└── data/ (French sentences folder)
```

### **Why This Works:**
- **`play.html`** has direct access to `script.js` and `data/` folder
- **Iframe isolation** prevents homepage/game conflicts
- **Proper paths** ensure all resources load correctly

---

## 🎉 **Expected Result:**

After uploading, your visitors will get:
1. **Professional homepage** explaining the game
2. **Working game page** with all topics loading
3. **Full-screen game experience** (no cut-offs)
4. **Mobile-friendly** design
5. **AdSense-ready** layout for maximum revenue

**Upload those 2 files now and your game will work perfectly!** 🚀
